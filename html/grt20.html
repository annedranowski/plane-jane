                            modules, and establish a covariant pairing between modules of these two types. We show that
                            every module in this category, which is finitely generated over the algebra of functions, is
                            projective, and state a conjecture that gauge modules exhaust all such modules. We give a

                        <td>Each complex semisimple Lie algebra carries an adjoint quotient mapping, and this connects
                            representation theory to matters of complete integrability. Such connections are
                            particularly apparent if one considers the so-called “universal centralizer”, a symplectic
                            variety on which the adjoint quotient manifests as a completely integrable system. While
                            this system has non-compact fibres, Balibanu’s recent work shows it to admit a certain
                            fibrewise compactification. The total space of her fibrewise compactification is a
                            log-symplectic variety, and its geometry is intimately related to the De Concini–Procesi
                            wonderful compactification of the adjoint group <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>.
                            On the other hand, each choice of regular element produces a Mishchenko–Fomenko map on the
                            given Lie algebra. This map turns out to manifest as a completely integrable system on a
                            certain Kostant–Whittaker reduction of <span
                                class="math inline"><em>T</em><sup>*</sup><em>G</em></span>, and one can likewise seek a
                            fibrewise compactification. I will discuss some partial results in this direction,
                            emphasizing a role played by the log-cotangent bundle of the wonderful compactification.

                            transformation. Promotion is defined purely combinatorially on the set of order ideals. By
                            Rush and Shi, it is shown that this action has order <span
                                class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> for the order ideal poset of a cominuscule poset
                            where <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> is the Coxeter number for the
                            corresponding root system. On the other hand, the action of Auslander-Reiten translation on
                            the level of Grothendieck group induces an action called the Coxeter transformation. We
                            consider the action of the Coxeter transformation on the incidence algebra of the order
                            ideal poset of a cominuscule poset. We prove that the Coxeter transformation is periodic on
                            this algebra of order <span class="math inline"><em>h</em> + 1</span> (up to a sign) in most
                            cases. To understand the relationship between Promotion and Coxeter transformation, we will
                            combinatorially describe the orbits of Auslander-Reiten translation on the order ideal
                            posets of cominuscule posets.</td>

                        <td>Around 2007, Braden, Licata, Proudfoot and I came up with the slightly daft idea that
                            certain singular symplectic varieties come in dual pairs whose definition we could not
                            explain, with relations between them that we struggled to articulate, let alone prove. By
                            2014, we were able to produce at least a coherent list of properties we expected to match in
                            dual pairs, the most striking being a Koszul duality between associated category O’s. This
                            was either excellent or terrible timing (depending on your perspective), since immediately
                            afterwards Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima produced a uniform construction of a huge number of
                            examples, including almost all of those known to us. I’ll take this talk as an opportunity
                            to organize where we stand on the relationship between our work and BFN’s, as well as the
                            copious follow-up work which has appeared since their paper.</td>
