<td>I will give an overview talk about the first few topics of the seminar, which are: <span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span> modules, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and Beilinson-Bernstein localization. I will try to give a very explicit, calculation-based introduction to these topics, focusing on the example of <span class="math inline">‚Ñô<sup>1</sup></span> (which will explain the representation theory of <span class="math inline">ùî∞ùî©<sub>2</sub></span>) without worrying too much about technical points. In the following weeks we will try to fill in the details of these arguments, but I thought it would be good for everyone to be on the same page about what we‚Äôre trying to understand, so that we‚Äôre motivated for the more technical talks.</td>

I won‚Äôt exactly follow these notes in my talk, but they carefully explain the conventions that I will use (which are not completely standard, despite being canonical) and might be helpful to look at before/during/after the talk. This should be the last talk on BB localization and D modules for now, but we will return to these topics when we discuss the proof of the Kahzdan-Lusztig conjectures.</td>

<td><a href="sd1.pdf">Reminder on perverse sheaves and the equivariant derived category</a></td>
<td>In the first half, I‚Äôll give a reminder on perverse sheaves, beginning with recalling the definition of the perverse <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>-structure on <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>c</em></sub><sup><em>b</em></sup>(<em>X</em>)</span> before recalling the various exactness results we proved last year. These will be illustrated by a series of example computations, which will be either parallel to computations we‚Äôve hopefully all seen in category <span class="math inline">ùí™</span>, or will be continuations of the exercises done in the first reminder talk on constructible sheaves. The second half will introduce the Bernstein-Lunts equivariant derived category. Equivariant derived categories will feature heavily in the applications chapters, and we‚Äôll begin by briefly motivating them by considering their analogues on the level of functions. We will follow a mixture of Achar ch.¬†6 and Ch. 2 and 3 of Bernstein, Lunts, Equivariant sheaves and functors.</td>

In the second half, I will discuss equivariant <span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span> modules, the relation of equivariance to integrability of <span class="math inline">ùî§</span>-modules under Beilinson-Bernstein localization, and explain how this allows us to reduce the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture to a statement about <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> equivariant sheaves on <span class="math inline"><em>G</em>/<em>B</em></span>.</td>

<td><a href="sd2.pdf">Statement of proof of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture</a></td>
<td>In the first part of the talk, I‚Äôll define the Hecke algebra and formulate Kazhdan-Lusztig conjectures. The Hecke algebra is equipped with three natural bases and an involution, and we will see what this data corresponds to in each of the pictures I‚Äôll talk about the category of <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>-equivariant perverse sheaves on <span class="math inline"><em>G</em>/<em>B</em></span> and how to convolve them (it is this operation which requires visiting the equivariant derived category), which will lead to a categorification of the Hecke algebra in terms of the additive category of the so-called semisimple complexes. From here we will be able to prove the conjecture and comment on categorifications of Hecke algebras in other contexts. The talk is based primarily on sections 7.1 through 7.3 of Achar, but see also Kostya‚Äôs notes from the seminar last year for an alternative proof of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjectures which does not require the equivariant derived category, but which also does not give a categorification of the Hecke algebra.</td>
