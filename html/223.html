<p>There are two types of homework in this class: online graded homework and non-graded homework. They have different focuses. The online homework focuses on computations and algorithms. These are like the times-tables of linear algebra—you need to have them down pat in order to do well, but <em>there is little to them beyond practice</em>. The non-graded homework focuses on conceptual questions related to lecture content. To do well in this class, you must do both types of homework.</p>
<h2 id="online-homework">Online Homework</h2>
<p>Online homework is due weekly via the WebWork platform. Most weeks, online homework will focus on algorithms that have not been discussed in lecture. Before you start your online homework each week, <em>please watch the provided videos</em>, which will explain the algorithm to be practised.</p>
<h2 id="writing-homework">Writing Homework</h2>
<p>Writing homework assignments are due is due <em>Friday, November 1 at 11:59pm, Friday, November 8 at 11:59pm, and Friday November 29 at 11:59pm</em> and are to be submitted <em>via Crowdmark</em>. Each writing assignment includes a problem to be completed using the Peer Assisted Reflection (PAR) process, which requires you to bring a draft of your solution(s) to lecture on particular days. The PAR day for each writing homework will be announced via Quercus.</p>
