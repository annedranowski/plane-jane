                            All these rings have several common features: they all have a distinguished Schubert basis;
                            the Schubert structure constants count certain intersection points; the Schubert classes can
                            be defined by equivariant localization. A question with roots in representation theory and
                            microlocal analysis is whether there are good analogues of Schubert classes to study
                            intersection rings of the cotangent bundle of a flag manifold. One answer, coming from
                            singularity theory, leads to the study of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of Schubert
                            cells. For flag manifolds, these classes are Schubert positive, and they are equivalent to
                            the stable envelopes on the cotangent bundle, defined recently by Maulik and Okounkov. I
                            will explain these ideas, and draw parallels with the Schubert Calculus situation. For
                            instance, instead of counting points in three Schubert cycles, in the cotangent situation
                            one takes the Euler characteristic of the intersection of three Schubert cells. Based on
                            joint work with Paolo Aluffi, Jorg Schurmann and Changjian Su.</td>

                            geometry of moduli space of algebraic curves. Moreover, conformal blocks can be identified
