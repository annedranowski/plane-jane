                            All these rings have several common features: they all have a distinguished Schubert basis;
                            the Schubert structure constants count certain intersection points; the Schubert classes can
                            be defined by equivariant localization. A question with roots in representation theory and
                            microlocal analysis is whether there are good analogues of Schubert classes to study
                            intersection rings of the cotangent bundle of a flag manifold. One answer, coming from
                            singularity theory, leads to the study of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of Schubert
                            cells. For flag manifolds, these classes are Schubert positive, and they are equivalent to
                            the stable envelopes on the cotangent bundle, defined recently by Maulik and Okounkov. I
                            will explain these ideas, and draw parallels with the Schubert Calculus situation. For
                            instance, instead of counting points in three Schubert cycles, in the cotangent situation
                            one takes the Euler characteristic of the intersection of three Schubert cells. Based on

                            the same vein, Crawley-Boevey-Shaw defined multiplicative preprojective algebras (MPAs) to
                            encode solutions of the multiplicative Deligne-Simpson problem. For historical motivation,
                            I’ll present the ideas behind these two constructions. More recently, MPAs have gained

                            Bezrukavnikov-Kapranov, among others. In joint work with Travis Schedler, we ask which
                            algebraic properties of preprojective algebras still hold for MPAs. We prove that the
                            behavior is similar for quivers containing a cycle, as the MPA is 2-Calabi-Yau and prime,
                            with trivial center when the containment is proper. Moreover, the MPA for a cycle is a
                            non-commutative resolution of its center. I’ll summarize the key ideas behind this work
                            without assuming intimate knowledge of preprojective algebras.</td>

                            usual Grassmannian. Transversal slices to these cells give an interesting family of Poisson
                            varieties. Some of them admit a smooth symplectic resolution and have an interesting
                            geometry related to the representation theory of the Langlands dual group <span

                            cohomology of such resolutions and will show how the trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
                            equation arises as a quantum differential equation in this setting.</td>
