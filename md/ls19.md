|Sept 27| Dylan | Overview | I will give an overview talk about the first few topics of the seminar, which are: $D$ modules, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and Beilinson-Bernstein localization. I will try to give a very explicit, calculation-based introduction to these topics, focusing on the example of $\mathbb P^1$ (which will explain the representation theory of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$) without worrying too much about technical points. In the following weeks we will try to fill in the details of these arguments, but I thought it would be good for everyone to be on the same page about what we're trying to understand, so that we're motivated for the more technical talks.|
