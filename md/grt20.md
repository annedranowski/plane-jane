|Jan 10 | Representations of Lie algebras of vector fields on algebraic varieties | Yuly Billig | We study a category of representations of the Lie algebras of vector fields on an affine algebraic variety $X$ that admit a compatible action of the algebra of polynomial functions on $X$. We investigate two classes of simple modules in this category: gauge modules and Rudakov modules, and establish a covariant pairing between modules of these two types. We show that every module in this category, which is finitely generated over the algebra of functions, is projective, and state a conjecture that gauge modules exhaust all such modules. We give a proof of this conjecture when $X$ is the affine space. This is a joint work with Slava Futorny, Jonathan Nilsson, Andre Zaidan, Colin Ingalls and Amir Nasr. |
|Jan 10 (3:30-4:30) | Michael McBreen | Hypertoric varieties and graph invariants | Deletion and contraction are basic operations that reduce complicated graphs to simpler ones. I will discuss deletion and contraction relations for hypertoric varieties, touching on joint work with Zsuzsana Dancso and Vivek Shende on the one hand and Michael Groechenig on the other. |
|Jan 17 | Peter Crooks | Towards a fibrewise compactification of the Mishchenko--Fomenko system | Each complex semisimple Lie algebra carries an adjoint quotient mapping, and this connects representation theory to matters of complete integrability. Such connections are particularly apparent if one considers the so-called "universal centralizer", a symplectic variety on which the adjoint quotient manifests as a completely integrable system. While this system has non-compact fibres, Balibanu's recent work shows it to admit a certain fibrewise compactification. The total space of her fibrewise compactification is a log-symplectic variety, and its geometry is intimately related to the De Concini--Procesi wonderful compactification of the adjoint group $G$. On the other hand, each choice of regular element produces a Mishchenko--Fomenko map on the given Lie algebra. This map turns out to manifest as a completely integrable system on a certain Kostant--Whittaker reduction of $T^*G$, and one can likewise seek a fibrewise compactification. I will discuss some partial results in this direction, emphasizing a role played by the log-cotangent bundle of the wonderful compactification. |
|Jan 24 | Justin Hilburn | HOMFLY-PT Knot Homology and 3d Mirror Symmetry | In this talk I would like to explain how the equivalence of two mathematical constructions of HOMFLY-PT knot homology follows from mirror symmetry for topologically twisted 3$d$ $N=4$ theories. The first construction due to Oblomkov-Rozansky involves certain categories of matrix factorizations and the second which is related to work of Gorsky-Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende involves the cohomology of affine Springer fibers. Joint work with T Dimofte, N Garner, A Oblomkov, L Rozansky. |
|Jan 31 | Emine Yildrim | The Coxeter Transformation and Promotion | In this talk, we will talk about two seemingly unrelated actions, Promotion and Coxeter transformation. Promotion is defined purely combinatorially on the set of order ideals. By Rush and Shi, it is shown that this action has order $h$ for the order ideal poset of a cominuscule poset where $h$ is the Coxeter number for the corresponding root system. On the other hand, the action of Auslander-Reiten translation on the level of Grothendieck group induces an action called the Coxeter transformation. We consider the action of  the Coxeter transformation on the incidence algebra of the order ideal poset of a cominuscule poset. We prove that the Coxeter transformation is periodic on this algebra of order $h+1$ (up to a sign) in most cases. To understand the relationship between Promotion and Coxeter transformation, we will combinatorially describe the orbits of Auslander-Reiten translation on the order ideal posets of cominuscule posets.|
|Feb 7 | Ben Webster | S(ymplectic) duality: where do we stand? | Around 2007, Braden, Licata, Proudfoot and I came up with the slightly daft idea that certain singular symplectic varieties come in dual pairs whose definition we could not explain, with relations between them that we struggled to articulate, let alone prove. By 2014, we were able to produce at least a coherent list of properties we expected to match in dual pairs, the most striking being a Koszul duality between associated category O's. This was either excellent or terrible timing (depending on your perspective), since immediately afterwards Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima produced a uniform construction of a huge number of examples, including almost all of those known to us. I'll take this talk as an opportunity to organize where we stand on the relationship between our work and BFN's, as well as the copious follow-up work which has appeared since their paper.|
|Feb 14| Yiqiang Li | Spaltenstein varieties of pure dimension | Spaltenstein varieties are natural generalizations of Springer fibers. Unlike Springer fibers, not much is known about their pure dimensionality which have potential application in representation theory. In this talk, we will present the recent progress in this direction in the classical cases.  |
|Feb 28| Joel Kamnitzer | Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles, preprojective algebra modules and Duistermaat-Heckman measures | Via the geometric Satake correspondence, the Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles give bases for representations of semisimple Lie algebras.  Similarly, by work of Lusztig, generic preprojective algebra modules give bases for these representations as well. It is a long-standing open problem to compare these bases. We will explain a new geometric way to make this comparison. As an application, we will show that these bases do not agree in $SL_6$.|
| Mar 6| Tudor Padurariu | $K$-theoretic Hall algebras for quivers with potential | Given a quiver with potential, Kontsevich-Soibelman constructed a Hall algebra on the cohomology of the stack of representations of $(Q,W)$. In particular cases, one recovers positive parts of Yangians as defined by Maulik-Okounkov. For general $(Q,W)$, the Hall algebra has nice structure properties, for example Davison-Meinhardt proved a PBW theorem for it using the decomposition theorem. One can define a $K$-theoretic version of this algebra using certain categories of singularities that depend on the stack of representations of $(Q,W)$. In particular cases, these Hall algebras are positive parts of quantum affine algebras. We show that some of the structure properties in cohomology, such as the PBW theorem, can be lifted to $K$-theory, replacing the use of the decomposition theorem with semi-orthogonal decompositions. |
| Mar 12 at 14:30 in HU1018 | Tatsuya Horiguchi | A monomial basis for the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties | Hessenberg varieties are subvarieties of a flag variety whose topology are related to other research areas such as hyperplane arrangements and graph theory. In this talk, we show that the set of certain monomials form a basis for the cohomology ring of a regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety. The monomial basis is important in Schubert calculus in the case of the flag variety. This is joint work with Megumi Harada, Satoshi Murai, Martha Precup, and Julianna Tymoczko. | 
| Mar 19 at 14:00 in Stewart | Hiraku Abe | The integral cohomology rings of Peterson varieties | The rational cohomology ring of the Peterson variety is isomorphic to the $S_n$-invariant subring of the cohomology ring of the toric variety associated to the fan consisting of the set of Weyl chambers. In this talk, I will explain that the same isomorphism works over the integral coefficients in type $A$ by taking a geometric point of view. |
