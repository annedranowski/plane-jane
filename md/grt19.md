|Day| Speaker|Title|Abstract|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sept 6| Andrey Smirnov | 3d mirror symmetry for elliptic stable envelopes|In this talk I will describe the elliptic stable envelope classes introduced recently by M.Aganagic and A. Okounkov. I will discuss some properties of these classes expected from 3d mirror symmetry. The plan is to consider the case of $X=T^*\mathbb P^1$ in all details and then discuss known and expected generalizations.|
|Sept 13 | Xin Jin | Homological mirror symmetry for the universal centralizer | I will present work in progress on the homological mirror symmetry for the universal centralizer $J_G$ associated to a semisimple Lie group $G$. The A-side will be a partially wrapped Fukaya category of $J_G$, and the B-side will be the derived category of coherent sheaves on the GIT-quotient of the dual torus of the maximal torus by the Weyl group action (with some modification if $G$ is not of adjoint type).|
|Sept 20 | Shiyu Shen | Tamely ramified geometric Langlands correspondence in positive characteristic| I will describe a generic version of the tamely ramified geometric Langlands correspondence (GLC) in positive characteristic for $GL_n$, generalizing the work of Bezrukavnikov-Braverman on the unramified case. Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p>n$. I will give a spectral description of the parabolic Hitchin fibration over an open dense subset of the Hitchin base, and describe a correspondence between flat connections with regular singularities on X and twisted Higgs bundles on the Frobenius twist $X^{(1)}$. Then I will explain how to use a twisted version of the Fourier-Mukai transform to establish the GLC |
|Sept 27 | Leonardo Mihalcea | Cotangent Schubert Calculus | Modern Schubert Calculus studies various intersection rings associated to flag manifolds. All these rings have several common features: they all have a distinguished Schubert basis; the Schubert structure constants count certain intersection points; the Schubert classes can be defined by equivariant localization. A question with roots in representation theory and microlocal analysis is whether there are good analogues of Schubert classes to study intersection rings of the cotangent bundle of a flag manifold. One answer, coming from singularity theory, leads to the study of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of Schubert cells. For flag manifolds, these classes are Schubert positive, and they are equivalent to the stable envelopes on the cotangent bundle, defined recently by Maulik and Okounkov. I will explain these ideas, and draw parallels with the Schubert Calculus situation. For instance, instead of counting points in three Schubert cycles, in the cotangent situation one takes the Euler characteristic of the intersection of three Schubert cells. Based on joint work with Paolo Aluffi, Jorg Schurmann and Changjian Su. |
| Oct 4 | Jiuzu Hong |Conformal blocks for Galois covers of algebraic curves | The theory of conformal blocks is important in 2d conformal field theory. It is defined via Wess-Witten-Zumino, more precisely in terms of Kac-Moody theory. It is related to the geometry of moduli space of algebraic curves. Moreover, conformal blocks can be identified with the theta functions on the moduli stack of principle $G$-bundles. I will talk about a twisted theory of conformal blocks attached to Galois covers of algebraic curves, where twisted Kac-Moody algebra will play key roles. I will also talk about the identification between twisted conformal blocks and the theta functions on the moduli stack of torsors over parahoric Bruhat-Tits group schemes over curves. This talk is based on the joint work with Shrawan Kumar. |

| Oct 25 | Chris Elliott | | 
| Nov 1 | Sasha Shapiro & Andrei Okounkov | |
| Nov 22 | Ivan Danilenko | Slices of the Affine Grassmannian and Quantum Cohomology | The Affine Grassmannian is an ind-scheme associated to a reductive group $G$. It has a cell structure similar to the one in the usual Grassmannian. Transversal slices to these cells give an interesting family of Poisson varieties. Some of them admit a smooth symplectic resolution and have an interesting geometry related to the representation theory of the Langlands dual group $G^\vee$. We will focus on equivariant cohomology of such resolutions and will show how the trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation arises as a quantum differential equation in this setting. |
