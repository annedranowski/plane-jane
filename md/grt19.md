|Day| Speaker|Title|Abstract|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sept 6| Andrey Smirnov | 3d mirror symmetry for elliptic stable envelopes|In this talk I will describe the elliptic stable envelope classes introduced recently by M.Aganagic and A. Okounkov. I will discuss some properties of these classes expected from 3d mirror symmetry. The plan is to consider the case of $X=T^*\mathbb P^1$ in all details and then discuss known and expected generalizations.|
|Sept 13 | Xin Jin | Homological mirror symmetry for the universal centralizer | I will present work in progress on the homological mirror symmetry for the universal centralizer $J_G$ associated to a semisimple Lie group $G$. The A-side will be a partially wrapped Fukaya category of $J_G$, and the B-side will be the derived category of coherent sheaves on the GIT-quotient of the dual torus of the maximal torus by the Weyl group action (with some modification if $G$ is not of adjoint type).|
|Sept 20 | Shiyu Shen | Tamely ramified geometric Langlands correspondence in positive characteristic| I will describe a generic version of the tamely ramified geometric Langlands correspondence (GLC) in positive characteristic for $GL_n$, generalizing the work of Bezrukavnikov-Braverman on the unramified case. Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p>n$. I will give a spectral description of the parabolic Hitchin fibration over an open dense subset of the Hitchin base, and describe a correspondence between flat connections with regular singularities on X and twisted Higgs bundles on the Frobenius twist $X^{(1)}$. Then I will explain how to use a twisted version of the Fourier-Mukai transform to establish the GLC |
|Sept 27 | Leonardo Mihalcea | Cotangent Schubert Calculus | Modern Schubert Calculus studies various intersection rings associated to flag manifolds. All these rings have several common features: they all have a distinguished Schubert basis; the Schubert structure constants count certain intersection points; the Schubert classes can be defined by equivariant localization. A question with roots in representation theory and microlocal analysis is whether there are good analogues of Schubert classes to study intersection rings of the cotangent bundle of a flag manifold. One answer, coming from singularity theory, leads to the study of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of Schubert cells. For flag manifolds, these classes are Schubert positive, and they are equivalent to the stable envelopes on the cotangent bundle, defined recently by Maulik and Okounkov. I will explain these ideas, and draw parallels with the Schubert Calculus situation. For instance, instead of counting points in three Schubert cycles, in the cotangent situation one takes the Euler characteristic of the intersection of three Schubert cells. Based on joint work with Paolo Aluffi, Jorg Schurmann and Changjian Su. |
| Oct 4 | Jiuzu Hong |Conformal blocks for Galois covers of algebraic curves | The theory of conformal blocks is important in 2d conformal field theory. It is defined via Wess-Witten-Zumino, more precisely in terms of Kac-Moody theory. It is related to the geometry of moduli space of algebraic curves. Moreover, conformal blocks can be identified with the theta functions on the moduli stack of principle $G$-bundles. I will talk about a twisted theory of conformal blocks attached to Galois covers of algebraic curves, where twisted Kac-Moody algebra will play key roles. I will also talk about the identification between twisted conformal blocks and the theta functions on the moduli stack of torsors over parahoric Bruhat-Tits group schemes over curves. This talk is based on the joint work with Shrawan Kumar. | 
| Oct 11 | Iva Halacheva | From puzzles to Lagrangian correspondences: a branching story|Puzzles in Schubert calculus were originally developed by Knutson and Tao as combinatorial objects for computing the expansion of the product of two Grassmannian Schubert classes. I will present a puzzle rule for restricting type A Schubert classes for the Grassmannian to type C in equivariant cohomology. The proof uses the machinery of quantum integrable systems. I will then describe work in progress toward an extension of this rule to cotangent bundles in the context of Lagrangian correspondences between symplectic resolutions and Maulik—Okounkov classes. This is joint work with A. Knutson and P. Zinn-Justin.| 
| Oct 18 | Linhui Shen | Double Bott-Samelson cells and cluster algebras| We introduce the double Bott-Samelson cell associated to an arbitrary Kac-Moody group $G$ and a pair of positive braids $(b, d)$. We prove that the double Bott-Samelson cells are affine varieties whose coordinate rings are upper cluster algebras. We describe the Donaldson-Thomas transformation on double Bott-Samelson cells. As an application, we obtain a new geometric proof of Zamolodchikov’s periodicity conjecture in the cases of type $\Delta\otimes A$.  If time permits, I will further talk about its connections with Knot theory and quantum groups.  This is joint work with Daping Weng. |
| Oct 23, 1 pm-2:30 pm | Jose Simental Rodriguez | Finite-dimensional representations of quantized Gieseker varieties |  Quantized Gieseker algebras arise as the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the algebra of differential operators on the framed representation space of the Jordan quiver. Examples of these include algebras of differential operators on projective space as well as type $A$ spherical rational Cherednik algebras. It turns out that when a quantized Gieseker algebra admits a finite-dimensional representation, the category of its finite-dimensional representations is equivalent to that of vector spaces. I will give all necessary definitions and then explain how the unique irreducible finite-dimensional representation of the quantized Gieseker algebra can be obtained from the finite-dimensional representation of the type $A$ (full) rational Cherednik algebra, which allows us to compute the dimension (and character) of this representation. This is joint work with P. Etingof, V. Krylov and I. Losev. |
| Oct 25 | Chris Elliott | A Catalogue of Twists for Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory| The theory of Factorization Algebras, developed by Costello and Gwilliam, provides a mathematical way of studying quantum field theory.  In this talk I'll discuss joint work with Pavel Safronov and Brian Williams, in which we develop the theory of "topological twisting" for supersymmetric theories using this technology.  This is a procedure that starts with a supersymmetric quantum field theory on $\mathbb R^n$ that depends on a choice of Riemannian metric, and produces a new quantum field theory that is defined on more general $n$-manifolds, and only depends on a coarser structure than a metric such as a choice of orientation. We classify and describe all examples of quantum field theories in all dimensions that arise by twisting a supersymmetric gauge theory. | 
| Nov 1, 1 pm -2:30 | Andrei Okounkov | $3d$-mirror symmetry and real life | Three-dimensional mirror symmetry (also known as symplectic duality, and under other names), is a beautiful idea that drives a lot of current research in enumerative geometry and geometric representation theory. The talk will be contain an introduction to the subject, an overview of how it appears in more familiar parts of mathematics (e.g. Macdonald theory), and, time permitting, some description of ideas that are used in actual proofs.|
| Nov 1, 2:30 pm- 4:00 |   Sasha Shapiro | Cluster structure on K-theoretic Coulomb branches | It was conjectured by Gaiotto, that (quantized) K-theoretic Coulomb branches of $3d \mathcal{N} =4$ SUSY gauge theories, as defined by Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima, bear structure of (quantum) cluster varieties. I will outline a proof of this conjecture for quiver gauge theories, provided that the quiver does not have loops. In relation to this conjecture, I will also discuss why positive and Gelfand-Tsetlin representations of quantum groups are unitary equivalent, and how to construct higher rank Fenchel–Nielsen coordinates on moduli spaces of $PGL_n$ local systems. This is a joint work with Gus Schrader.|
| Nov 13 | Dan Kaplan | The Structure of Multiplicative Preprojective Algebras | Crawley-Boevey defined deformed preprojective algebras as a means of viewing solutions to the  additive Deligne-Simpson problem as irreducible representations of these algebras. In the same vein, Crawley-Boevey-Shaw defined multiplicative preprojective algebras (MPAs) to encode solutions of the multiplicative Deligne-Simpson problem. For historical motivation, I'll present the ideas behind these two constructions. More recently, MPAs have gained popularity in geometry thanks to work of Van den Bergh, Yamakawa, Etgu-Lekili, and Bezrukavnikov-Kapranov, among others. In joint work with Travis Schedler, we ask which algebraic properties of preprojective algebras still hold for MPAs. We prove that the behavior is similar for quivers containing a cycle, as the MPA is 2-Calabi-Yau and prime, with trivial center when the containment is proper. Moreover, the MPA for a cycle is a non-commutative resolution of its center. I'll summarize the key ideas behind this work without assuming intimate knowledge of preprojective algebras.| 
| Nov 22 | Ivan Danilenko | Slices of the Affine Grassmannian and Quantum Cohomology | The Affine Grassmannian is an ind-scheme associated to a reductive group $G$. It has a cell structure similar to the one in the usual Grassmannian. Transversal slices to these cells give an interesting family of Poisson varieties. Some of them admit a smooth symplectic resolution and have an interesting geometry related to the representation theory of the Langlands dual group $G^\vee$. We will focus on equivariant cohomology of such resolutions and will show how the trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation arises as a quantum differential equation in this setting. |
