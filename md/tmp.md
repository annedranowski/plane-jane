I believe that chief among my responsibilities as teacher is to train my
students in the practice of mathematics by giving clear instructions,
demonstrating proper form and providing effective feedback.

The way that I fulfill my responsibilities has evolved over the years,
based on the very effective direct and indirect feedback my students as
well as my peers and mentors have given me. Based on two course
evaluations and numerous Teaching Assistant evaluations, the one
constant throughout has been my high approachability factor.

The first time I taught a course at the University of Toronto was in the
summer of 2017. The topic was Groups & Symmetries and the experience was
harrowing. Students either excelled or failed, loved me or detested me.
My syllabus consisted of three hour long tests, five short quizzes, one
assignment and one final exam. My motto was "abstractions couched in
examples and computations."

The experience taught me three important lessons. First, I will
underestimate the difficulty of my assessments. Second, I will
overestimate my ability to convey information, and my students' ability
to absorb it. Third, coordinating a course is a full-time job.

Recalibrating paid off; the following summer I was recognized by my
algebra students with the University of Toronto **DeLury TA award** for
outstanding performance as a Teaching Assistant and for my significant
contribution to undergraduate teaching in the department.

This summer I taught my second course, a double-speed section of
multivariable calculus for majors. My class convened twice a week for
three hour lectures. One week in, I asked my students to complete a fast
feedback survey. The responses were overall positive, but the response
rate was low. In an effort to push my students to reflect on the course
material, as well as to gauge how well I was communicating it, I closed
the survey with the following open ended prompt.

> Use this space to give examples of positive and/or negative learning
> experiences you have had in lecture so far. (For example, "When my
> instructor made X analogy, the notion of Y became clear." Or, "When my
> instructor said X and Y, I became more confused about Z.")

The following feedback transformed the way I structure my lectures.

> Theorems and definitions are explicitly demonstrated, which is good.
> However, I would like to hear more about how you come to that theorem
> and how can I use the theorem to solve problems. In the end of the
> lecture, maybe we can have a small recap about everything we learned

I identified in this three challenges. (Two of which I thought I had
been addressing!)

1.  How do we come up with theorems?

2.  How do we use theorems?

3.  Can we have a summary?

To better address the second challenge I have increased the number of
problems I take up with my students in class. To address the third
challenge I have introduced a "cue column" in my lectures. This is a
space of the board reserved for building an outline of important
concepts/results/techniques that crop up throughout the lecture.

To better address the first challenge, whenever possible, I anchor the
day's topics in practical situations. I also continue to draw parallels
to that with which my students have been familiarized, in hopes of
alerting them to the deliberate progression of the lectures.

This term I am teaching my third course, two sections of linear algebra.
For the first time, I am teaching in the active learning style. This
means that my students spend approximately 40% of lecture working
through problems on their own or in teams. Structuring my lectures to
deliver on my training goals is a challenge I am embracing. The time
constraints of lecturing limit me to "telling" my students mathematical
conventions and formalisms. The rest of the time that I am addressing
the entire class I focus on carefully leading a discussion about a
problem toward the discovery of its correct solution.

This new framework has impacted how I conceptualize my responsibilities
as a teacher. To give clear instructions means to simply ask the
students to work on certain problems for certain amounts of time, in
teams or individually. To demonstrate proper form means to perfect an
imperfect solution. The emphasis is almost completely shifted to
providing effective feedback. As much as possible I try to formulate my
feedback as a pointed question.

For example, on a practice midterm my linear algebra class had to
explain why a map that took four pairwise linearly independent vectors
to four not all pairwise linearly independent vectors could not be
linear. The question was not phrased like this. The students were just
presented with two different configurations of four points in the plane.
When students asked me where to begin, I deflected by asking them to
answer the question after deleting two points from both configurations.
If they needed a further nudge, I asked them to reflect on how their
answer might change if we replaced a deleted point. Together we
rediscovered that a linear transformation of $\mathbb R^2$ is determined
by its value on a basis, and that the rank of a linear transformation
does not depend on a basis.

For another example, when my multivariable calculus class had to learn
the Bolzano--Weierstrass theorem that says that every bounded sequence
in $\mathbb R^n$ has a convergent subsequence, I opted to present a
visual proof (versus leaving the proof to my students in the style of
R.L. Moore). I animated the inductive argument involved, using a large
textile grid and some volunteers.

My teaching experience so far has been of utmost importance to my
graduate studies. The skills I have developed and continue to develop as
a teacher make me a better mathematician and a better communicator. I
look forward to teaching and to continuing to grow as a teacher at your
university.
